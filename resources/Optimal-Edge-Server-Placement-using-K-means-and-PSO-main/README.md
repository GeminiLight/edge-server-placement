Optimal placement of edge servers using K-means Clustering and Power allocation using Particle Swarm Optimization

Through this model, we can find the ideal locations for placing the cloudlets so that end to end service delay is minimized.

This algorithm uses backhaul delay, processing delay to find ideal locations for placing the cloudlets. Service delay is used to select the transmission powers for various base stations.
In this way, end to service delay can be minimized through this model.
